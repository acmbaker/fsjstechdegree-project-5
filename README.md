# Full Stack JavaScript Project 5
For this project, I created a directory which used the random user API to fetch the data from.

## The Brief
For this project, you'll build an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

You’ll use the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.

You’ll request a JSON object from the API and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.

## Exceeds Expectations Requirements
Search form - the user can type in something to the search form and the employee directory is filtered live.

CSS changes - the page has been enhanced with different colours and fonts.

Modal popup - in the popup, the relevant buttons allow you to toggle between employees on the page.

## Outcome
Everything is functioning as per the brief and exceeded grade requirements.
